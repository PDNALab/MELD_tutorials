# Supplementary Information for MELD in Action: Harnessing Data to accelerate Molecular Dynamics

This repository contains tutorials for three MELDxMD applications

1. Folding of a miniprotein using only coarse physical insights (CPI) from sequence and secondary structure information
2. Modelling protein-protein complexes using NMR chemical shift perturbation data
3. Competitive binding simulations between two binders
