# Modelling Protein-Protein complexes using NMR CSP data

MELD can verify the binding modes of protein-protein complexes. Here, we will use NMR CSP data to extract the possible binding residues of the target protein. Specifically, residues with the largest CSP values, specifically those with ΔδN,H greater than 0.25 ppm, were considered _active residues_ and are presumed to be near the actual binding site. These values were calculated for ET-peptide complexes but are considered transferable to other ET-protein complexes. More information about these values can be found in:
